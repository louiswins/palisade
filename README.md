# TI-83 Plus Palisade

This is an implementation of the [Five Cells](http://nikoli.co.jp/en/puzzles/five_cells.html) logic puzzle. The name is
taken from [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/), although
it is reimplemented from scratch in Z80 assembly.

## Why the TI-83+?

TI-83+ BASIC was one of my first exposures to programming and I've always had a soft spot in my heart for it. I think
it's a great introduction since it's so easy to get something on the screen and moving around. But I've never really
dived into assembly language outside a single college course (plus the slight exposure I get from debugging C and C++).
So this is a chance for me to get back to my roots while still learning a new skill.

Don't expect good code or best practices here. This is my first real foray into assembly of any sort and it's my first
time _seeing_ Z80 asm at all. So I'm sure the code is crap. But it's fun! I'll be following [Learn TI-83 Plus Assembly
in 28 Days](https://gitlab.com/taricorp/83pa28d), perhaps the only tutorial.
